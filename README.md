# Python-Journey
I will be starting my journey into the world of Python. This repository will host all of the code and challenges that I will be doing over the next few months/years. Hopefully by the end this repo will be a mini documentation for the python language and various packages. 

So far the repo contains code for the basics of the language as well as demo projects using Matplotlib, Web.py and Flask.
